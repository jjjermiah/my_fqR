Goal:
- develop a package to read and manipulate fastq? formate sequence files
    - these are files produced by most DNA sequencers and they contain both 
    base calls and associated quality scores for multiple sequencers

- FastQ files are composed of entries consisting of 4 lines

1. ID line:
    starts with @symbol,
    seequence ID is anything after that
    IDs should be unique
2. Sequence line:
    should be a string of G/A/T/C/N bases
3. Mid line -
    starts with a + and are generally ignored?
4. Quality line:
    should be a string of charaters th same length as the sequence
